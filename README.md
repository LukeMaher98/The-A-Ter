# The-A-Ter
Prerequisites:
    - Python 3 (Possible incompatibilities if -v < 3.9)
    - PySimpleGui (pip install pysimplegui)
    - Software Metrics (pip install requests) (see guide below)

How To Run:
    - Copy repository into workspace
    - run main.py with "python main.py"

Walkthrough:
    - A user is prompted at the entry ui to login
    - A regular user can sign up for a new account, or log in if a previous customer
    - Users will be brought to the user main menu
    - Here they can:
        - See current screenings, make bookings for tickets, or purchase them
        - See the concessions and purchase them
        - Redeem their bookings to purchase tickets
    - Admins already have defined accounts and are brought to the admin menu
    - Here they can:
        - Alter screenings and concessions
        - View ticket and concession sales
        - View current bookings 
    - Users can log out when they are finished

ADDED VALUE 

Unit Tests:
    - In the same directory used to run the initial program run the unit tests with the following command:
        python -m unittest -v unittests/test_utils.py 
    - The tests should run automatically
    - Each tests case will print either 'ok' or 'FAIL'
    - In the case of a failure the actual and expected results will be printed for the user to compare  

Software Metrics:
    - For recording our software metrics we use Loggly
    - Users will need to run the command "pip install requests" 
    - Follow the guide to send logs to Loggly - https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/loggly/Content/getting-started/gsg-send_data.htm
    - Users DO NOT need to send logs in order for the program to run correctly.
